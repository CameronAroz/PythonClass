##Homework 3

##Part A:
#Import Library
from sys import argv

#Assign input to variable
number1 = int(argv[1])
number2 = int(argv[2])

#Prints Summation of Arguments
print number1 + number2

##Part B:
#1. Append/Extend/Pop/Sort/Reverse: Will not work on tuples because they cannot be changed
#2. Length and Type functions will work because they don't change the tuple


##Part E:
#In order to find the number of times and item appears in a list

#Declaration of the List
num = [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6]

print "Provided the List: num = [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6]"
print "The Number 1 appears:", num.count(1), "times"
